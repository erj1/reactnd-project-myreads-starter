# MyReads Project

Based from the Udacity provided [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter), 
this is my solution to the MyReads Project.

This project allows you to search for books and then add them to one of three pre-defined bookshelves.

## Installation

To install the project, you must run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/erj1/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
$ cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Testing

### Installation (Mac OS)

Before tests can be run, you will need to install `watchman`:

```
$ brew install watchman
```

### Running Tests

To run tests, you should only need to run 

```
$ yarn test
```


## Important

When searching for books, this project limits the search terms that can be used.  The list of available search terms
can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).

## Contributing

Because this project evaluates my ability to create a React project, I will not be accepting merge requests at this time.
However, please feel free to provide any helpful suggestions as I continue to learn React.
